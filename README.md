# vehicleCollisions

The aim of this study is to identify time intervals and areas that are accident-prone. The information recorded by Maryland State Police will also help to find correlations between entities involved in collisions and injuries. This investigation will focus on analysing collisions on county level. Maps are created using Tableau and some of the plots are created using Python with Spyder integrated development environment.
